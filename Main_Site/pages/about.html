    <h1>About Wyrd Foundation</h1>
    <p>I am a junior at the University of Montana, studying creative writing, English literature, and graphic design. I really love reading and writing. I mostly write fantasy, but I read fantasy, adventure, young adult, and sci-fi novels. I have two brothers, two parents, and four grandparents.</p>
    <p>I chose this project because I made these cupcakes for my boyfriend as a present during our last anniversary. At the time, he couldn't eat chocolate and felt like there were few desserts that were safe for him. I like this recipe because it's different from most other cake-like recipies, kind of like a cross between a cupcake and a danish or jelly donut. Also, other than cooking, I'm only really good at writing and swimming, which are hard to write instructions for.</p>
    <p>I got the recipies for the <a href="https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/raspberry-jam-buttercream-426448">frosting</a> and the <a href="https://www.wilton.com/cream-cheese-filling/WLRECIP-174.html">filling</a> on these sites.</p>
